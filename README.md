# MassLinkedinConnect
Automation of mass connect on Linkedin using Selenium.

Little automation process that connect all people related to the words you defined, on the amount pages that you defined.
In the code I've uploaded there's an example of connecting people on 5 pages, that are "Full stack developer".

To use the code you have to have Chrome webdriver, and specify the path of it (driver variable).

Enjoy!
